# PDF Environment
#
# The code in this file will only run when the app instance's environment = :pdf
# To do this, use the -e flag when running other commands:
# middleman build -e pdf, etc.
#
# In templates, you can test for the presence of a given environment by calling:
# environment? :pdf
# (for example). This will return a boolean
