Mosaics decorated domestic and public buildings across the broad expanse of the Roman Empire. Scenes drawn from mythology, daily life, nature, and spectacles in the arena enlivened interior spaces and reflected the cultural ambitions of wealthy patrons. Dating from the second through the sixth centuries AD, the mosaics in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum exemplify Roman mosaic production from its center in Italy to major workshops in North Africa, southern Gaul (present-day France), and ancient Syria. In addition to its comprehensive catalogue entries, this publication provides a detailed examination of the contexts in which the mosaics were discovered and excavated. This volume documents all twenty-one mosaics in the J. Paul Getty Museumâ€™s collection, presenting their artistry in new color photography.

This custom online catalogue enables a deeper exploration of these ancient objects, with zoomable high-resolution photography; embedded glossary terms and comparative images; and interactive maps drawn from the Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire. The complete catalogue can be downloaded for free in multiple formats, as can the object data and main images. For readers who wish to have a bound reference copy, a paperback version is available for sale.
