### Provenance

This mosaic panel was discovered near <span class="popup popup-location" data-location='<%= location("loc_21633") %>'>Hadrumetum</span> (present-day Sousse) on the east coast of Tunisia, but the exact findspot is unknown. It was excavated sometime before 1914.[^1] The J. Paul Getty Museum purchased the mosaic in 1973.[^2]

### Commentary

A ferocious lion attacks an onager, or wild ass, sinking its teeth and claws into the victim’s back and forcing the animal to the ground. The lion faces outward, directly engaging the viewer with its gaze, while the terrified onager struggles, twisting its head backward. This violent event is set in a landscape framed by trees. Blood from the wounded animal flows on the ground toward the bank of a spring or a stream. A guilloche pattern decorates the remains of the mosaic’s lower border.

The image of a lion tearing into the back of its captured prey was pervasive in mosaics of the Roman Empire. The motif had a long history in Near Eastern and Greek art, dating back to the Bronze Age, but immediate antecedents can be found in the fourth and third centuries BC in several Greek pebble mosaics, in which similar compositions appear as part of a decorative border. A mosaic floor of the early fourth century BC from the <span class="popup popup-pic" data-pic=' <%= pic("pic_15") %>'>House of the Mosaics</span> at <span class="popup popup-location" data-location='<%= location("loc_21973") %>'>Eretria</span> depicts a clash between a lion and a horse as part of a larger frieze including griffins and mythical human figures.[^3] Similarly, the decorative frieze of a mosaic from the Pompeion in Athens shows lions attacking animals in the corners and heraldic griffins reclining along the sides.[^4] By the third century BC, individual scenes of animals in combat are enlarged and placed in separate panels of the mosaic, giving them greater prominence. Pavements from a villa in Sparta and from the <span class="popup popup-pic" data-pic=' <%= pic("pic_16") %>'>peristyle of the House of the Mosaics</span> at <span class="popup popup-location" data-location='<%= location("loc_22634") %>'>Motya</span> (present day Mozia) in Sicily display framed scenes of lions attacking bulls.[^5] The example from Motya is placed next to an identical composition of a griffin with a horse.[^6] However, in contrast with the Roman version of the scene represented in the Getty mosaic, there is no indication of a landscape setting in these earlier works.

In Roman mosaics, the motif of animal combats became closely associated with themes of the amphitheater and the hunt, which were immensely popular forms of public entertainment involving wild animals and humans.[^7] At the same time, images of lions or other wild cats overpowering their fallen prey from behind, often depicted in a landscape setting, frequently appear as individual <span class="popup popup-definition" data-definition='<%= define_term("emblemata") %>'>*emblemata*</span>. The representations of these ferocious animals—on their own, facing outward to confront the viewer—may have served an apotropaic function, warding off evil, rather than a narrative one. The original context of the Getty mosaic is unknown, but it was likely an *emblema* in a much larger composition that included additional scenes decorating the floor of a wealthy Roman villa.

### Comparanda

Elements of the Getty mosaic resemble two relatively small mosaic panels that formed part of the floor decoration of the Imperial Palace of Hadrian’s Villa at Tivoli near Rome, dated about AD 120–30. In one example, from the Basilica of the Palace, a lion attacks a bull in a rugged landscape, while another bull observes from the background.[^8] The second mosaic, which originally adorned the main <span class="popup popup-definition" data-definition='<%= define_term("triclinium") %>'>*triclinium*</span>, depicts a battle between <span class="popup popup-pic" data-pic=' <%= pic("pic_16") %>'>wild cats and centaurs</span>, one of whom has been taken down by a tiger.[^9] The exceptionally detailed composition, naturalistic rendering of the scenery, and painterly style of these mosaics follow earlier Hellenistic Greek models, possibly copying a painting or *emblema* from that period.[^10] In comparison, the Getty mosaic, although similar to the pavements from Hadrian’s Villa in theme and composition, exhibits shallow perspective and a limited landscape that is more characteristic of Roman mosaics at the end of the second century AD. The Getty panel may have belonged to a series of individual mosaics depicting pairs of fighting animals, as seen in the decoration of the atrium of the third-century AD Villa of the Laberii at <span class="popup popup-location" data-location='<%= location("loc_21602") %>'>Oudna</span> in Tunisia. In this instance, a fragmentary mosaic panel showing a female lion overpowering an onager was one in a series placed between the columns of the courtyard.[^11]

Other mosaics with *emblemata* comparable to the Getty mosaic feature central mythological scenes of deities, most notably Dionysos, tamer of wild beasts and patron god of the Telegenii, an association in North Africa that participated in the organization of animal spectacles for the arena. A mosaic floor of the mid-second century AD that decorated the triclinium of the House of the Dionysiac Procession at <span class="popup popup-location" data-location='<%= location("loc_21592") %>'>Thysdrus</span> (present-day El Djem, near Sousse) includes a pair of similar mosaics depicting animal attacks, framed by a guilloche border.[^12] These were placed at either end of a processional scene of the child Dionysos riding a submissive lion. One mosaic panel depicts a <span class="popup popup-pic" data-pic=' <%= pic("pic_18") %>'>tiger and two onagers</span> in a rocky landscape with trees and is similar in composition to the mosaic with two bulls from Hadrian’s Villa but closer in style to the Getty panel. The tiger attacks one onager, while the second ass flees. The companion piece shows <span class="popup popup-pic" data-pic=' <%= pic("pic_19") %>'>two lions on either side of a boar</span>, also in a landscape setting. Like the lion in the Getty mosaic, the tiger and one of the lions stare straight out at the viewer. The expressive features of the lion in the Getty mosaic may place it closer in date to a similar representation of the scene on a <span class="popup popup-pic" data-pic=' <%= pic("pic_20") %>'>fragmentary panel</span> from <span class="popup popup-location" data-location='<%= location("loc_15897") %>'>Carthage</span> dating to the mid-third century AD, now in the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC[^13] This image, which also depicts a lion and an onager, is one of several animal scenes that once surrounded a central female figure riding in a chariot drawn by stags.[^14] The figure is probably Artemis the huntress, whose associated imagery, like that of Dionysus, includes wild animals.

### Condition

Only part of the left and bottom edges of the border survive. Some sections of the mosaic may have been restored in ancient times.[^15]
