          In Roman décor, elaborate mosaics transformed entire rooms into
          spectacular settings of vibrant color, figural imagery, and abstract
          design. Intricate patterns and figural compositions were created by
          setting tesserae—small pieces of stone or glass—into floors and walls.
          The mosaics in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum span the
          second through the sixth centuries AD and reveal the diversity of
          compositions found throughout the empire during this period. Recovered
          from various archaeological contexts, these mosaics provide a glimpse
          into the richly embellished architecture of the ancient world.

            Several mosaics in the Getty’s collection came from known sites
            in the Roman Empire and survived from antiquity in their original
            architectural contexts, having once decorated villas, baths,
            and churches. Presented here is rich archaeological evidence
            and new material documenting the mosaics’ modern discoveries,
            particularly from excavations in [Villelaure](../catalogue/excavations-villelaure/)
            and [Antioch](../catalogue/excavations-antioch/).

          This catalogue includes mosaics featured in <em>Roman Mosaics across the
          Empire.</em> Visitors to the 2016 exhibition at the Getty Villa experience
          the rare opportunity of viewing two Gallo-Roman mosaics from the same
          villa near Villelaure, France—the Getty’s Dares and Entellus mosaic and
          LACMA’s mosaic of Diana and Callisto.
