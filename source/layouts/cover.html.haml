          In Roman decor, elaborate mosaics transformed entire rooms into
          spectacular settings of vibrant color, figural imagery, and abstract
          design. Intricate patterns and narrative scenes were created by
          setting tesserae—small pieces of stone or glass—into floors and walls.
          The mosaics in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum span the
          second through the sixth centuries AD and reveal the diversity of
          compositions found throughout the empire during this period. Recovered
          from various archaeological contexts, these mosaics provide a glimpse
          into the richly embellished architecture of the ancient world.

            Several mosaics in the Getty’s collection came from known sites
            in the Roman Empire and survived from antiquity in their original
            architectural contexts, having once decorated villas, baths,
            and churches. Presented here is rich archaeological evidence
            and new material documenting the mosaics’ modern discoveries,
            particularly from excavations in [Villelaure](catalogue/excavations-villelaure/)
            and [Antioch](catalogue/excavations-antioch/).

            This catalogue includes mosaics featured in [*Roman Mosaics across the
            Empire*](http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/roman_mosaics/){:target="_blank"},
            on view at the Getty Villa in 2016. The exhibition showcases ten
            mosaics from the Getty alongside treasures on loan from other collections,
            including LACMA’s  mosaic of Diana and Callisto, which was discovered
            in the same villa in Villelaure as the Getty’s mosaic of Dares and Entellus.
